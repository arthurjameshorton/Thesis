\chapter{Additional Jet Studies}

Even with a jet calibration firmly in hand additional studies on jet phenomenology can go a long way towards advancing our knowledge of the jet response and potentially moving towards better calibrations in the future.  
In this chapter the question of how the energy from the hadronic recoil in the 2$\rightarrow$2 systems used in \textit {in-situ} calibration schemes is distributed around the jet axis is explored.  
The flow of energy across the boundary of the jet definition is also studied (see the showering correction in Sec.~\ref{sec:ShoweringIntro}).  
Finally some key assumptions used in the derivation of the MPF are examined, including the relationship between the response of the recoil and the response of the jet, as well as the effect of the underlying event on the derivation of the MPF.

As mentioned in Sec.~\ref{sec:ShoweringIntro} the majority of the energy from the hadronic recoil resides within a narrow energy dense core (the jet).  
In this section this statement is explored by measuring how the energy from the recoil is distributed around the calorimeter.  
This is done by measuring the average energy density in an annulus with an inner radius of $r-\Delta r$ and an inner radius of $r+\Delta r$, which is defined as
\begin{equation}
  \rho\left(r\right)  = \left( \frac{ E\left(r-\Delta r, r+\Delta r\right)}{\pi \left[\left(r +\Delta r\right)^2-\left(r -\Delta r\right)^2\right] E^{\mathrm{jet}}}\right), 
\end{equation}
where $E\left(r-\Delta r, r+\Delta r\right)$ is the sum of the energy of all clusters with a distance $R$ from the jet between $r-\Delta r$ and  $r+\Delta r$.  
As this thesis aims to measure this energy density profile in the context of an MPF based calibration results are obtained using the same selection used in the main analysis (see Sec.~\ref{Sec:SelectionCriteria}), and is also binned in $p_{\mathrm T}^{\mathrm{Ref}}$.  
The energy distribution using EM scale clusters at three different energies with Z+jet events are shown in Figs.~\ref{Fig:EMShape17-20},~\ref{Fig:EMShape60-80}, and~\ref{Fig:EMShape210-260}.  
One feature that should be understood is a dip in energy density at the boundary of the jet (in this case at $\Delta R = 0.4$).  
This dip is not a feature of the recoil or the calorimeter, but of the jet reconstruction algorithm, which creates an object which is centered on the most energetic clusters it contains.  
This dip can be explained by imagining a $\Delta R = 0.35$ jet growing into a $\Delta R = 0.4$ jet.  
If this jet growth only adds clusters with energies which are small with respect to the energy of the growing proto-jet the centre of the jet (the four-momentum sum of its constituents) does not move very much.  
If there is a cluster with a relatively high energy compared to the energy of the proto-jet the centre of the jet will move closer to this new addition.  
This process ensures that high energy clusters within a jet cannot be near the jet boundary.  
This process is especially evident for lower energy jets where even very small energy clusters represent a relatively large fraction of the total jet energy.

\end{figure}

At larger distances from the jet's core the energy density is relatively flat, which corresponds to the average pileup energy density.  
There is also a slight increase in the energy density with growing distance from the leading jet.  
This is caused by the presence of the subleading jet, which tends to be produces in the same hemisphere of the calorimeter as the reference object.

\section{Expanded MPF Derivation}

In Sec.~\ref{METProj} a derivation of the MPF was presented which considered only the hard scattering event, ignoring any potential effects of the underlying event.  
This potential deficiency in the derivation was justified by arguing that the underlying event is symmetric in $\phi$ when averaged over many events and therefore does not contribute to the measured MPF response.  
This assumption is tested in this section.  

The definition of the MPF in Eq.~\ref{EQ:MPFSimple}, is modified by a term $\Delta^{\mathrm{OA}}$ that accounts for the effect of other activity in the event on the MPF, 
\begin{equation}
  \label{Eq:MPFWithDelta}
  R_{\mathrm{recoil}}=1+\frac{\vec{E}_{\mathrm T}^{\mathrm{miss, recoil}}\cdot\hat{p}_{\mathrm T}^{\mathrm{ref}}}{E_{\mathrm T}^{\mathrm{ref}}} + \Delta^{\mathrm{OA}}, 
\end{equation}
\noindent
where it is explicitly shown that the original derivation assumed that the MET originated completely from the mismeasurement of the energy of the recoil.  
In an effort to obtain an expression in terms of measurable quantities $\vec{E}_{\mathrm T}^{\mathrm{miss, recoil}}$ is now expressed as 

\begin{equation}
  \vec{E}_{\mathrm T}^{\mathrm{miss, recoil}} = \vec{E}_{\mathrm T}^{\mathrm{recoil}} - \vec{E}_{\mathrm T}^{\mathrm{meas, recoil}}, 
\end{equation}
\noindent 
which is to say the amount of energy that isn't measured is equal to the total energy minus the energy that has been measured.  
Using the response $R_{\mathrm{recoil}}$ of the calorimeter for the recoil, 
\begin{equation}
  R_{\mathrm{recoil}}\vec{E}_{\mathrm T}^{\mathrm{recoil}} = \vec{E}_{\mathrm T}^{\mathrm{meas, recoil}}, 
\end{equation}
\noindent
which leads to 
\begin{equation}
  \vec{E}_{\mathrm T}^{\mathrm{miss, recoil}} = \vec{E}_{\mathrm T}^{\mathrm{meas, recoil}}\left(\frac{1-R_{\mathrm{recoil}}}{R_{\mathrm{recoil}}}\right).  
\end{equation}
\noindent
Using this definition of $\vec{E}_{\mathrm T}^{\mathrm{miss, recoil}}$ in Eq.~\ref{Eq:MPFWithDelta} and rearranging to solve for $\Delta^{\mathrm{OA}}$, the following expression is obtained for the contribution of the other activity to the MPF 
\begin{equation}
  \Delta^{\mathrm{OA}}=\left(R_{\mathrm{recoil}}-1\right)\left(1+\frac{\hat n_{\mathrm{ref}}\cdot \vec{E}_{\mathrm T}^{\mathrm{meas, recoil}}}{R_{\mathrm{recoil}}{E}_{\mathrm T}^{\mathrm{ref}}}\right).  
  \label{Eq:OA}
\end{equation} 
To use this expression both the response of the recoil and the measured recoil energy must be known, neither of which is true.  
To first order the effect of the other activity can be assumed to be small (as the MPF has been successfully used in jet calibration schemes in the past).  
This allows the use of the MPF itself as a measure of the response of the recoil.  
Obtaining a measurement of the full energy of the hadronic recoil at the detector level with the underlying event removed (and also without including pileup) is also a difficult issue.  
As the MPF technique already intimately connects the energy of the recoil to the energy of the jet this strategy will be used again.  
A range of jet cone sizes will be used ranging from a jet size parameter of $R$=0.1, which contains only the highest energy most central components of a jet, to $R$=1.0 which contains the vast majority of the hard scattering along with a significant amount of underlying event.   
As these are non-standard jet collections within the ATLAS collaboration the residual pileup correction is not available for all sizes considered, however it is still possible to remove the majority of the pileup from each jet using the jet area subtraction as described in Sec.~\ref{ATLASJES}.  

It is worth noting a few limitations of this technique before moving further.  
Just like in the derivation of the MPF substituting the energy of the leading jet for the energy of the recoil is a sensible substitution only when the leading jet does make up the majority of the recoil (when the balance is not spoils by ISR/FSR).  
This is ensured once again by applying both a $\Delta\phi$ and subleading jet (J2) requirement.  
In the case of this analysis $\Delta\phi\left(\mathrm{leading jet, ref}\right)$>2.9 and the $p_{\mathrm T}$ of the subleading jet without calibration must be less than 5\% of the $p_{\mathrm T}$ of the reference object ($p_{\mathrm T}^{J2}<0.05$ $p_{\mathrm T}^{\mathrm{Ref}}$).  
At low energies pileup becomes a larger issue, first by pileup jets being misidentified as the subleading jet which changes how strict the previous requirement is applied, and then by pileup jets being misidentified as the leading jet causing the event to fail the $\Delta\phi$ requirement.  
An example of how these effects change the measured response distribution in a $p_{\mathrm T}$ based response measurement can be seen in Fig.~\ref{Fig:BalDistExample}.

  \label{Fig:OA_7-10}
\end{figure}

This measure of the effect of the other activity on the MPF is shown as a function of $p_{\mathrm T}^{\mathrm Ref}$ using various jet sizes as a substitute for the energy of the recoil in Figs.~\ref{Fig:OA_1-4}~and~\ref{Fig:OA_7-10}.  
As seen in Sec.~\ref{Sec:EnergyDensity} the energy density of jets in the energy range considered remains large compared to that of pileup/underlying activity out to at least a distance of $\Delta\mathrm{r}=$ 0.4 away from the core.  
For this reason the use of jets reconstructed using size parameters lower than this value as a stand in for the energy of the recoil is known to be a bad approximation, and therefore this plots are included only for illustrative purposes.  
As shown in Fig.~\ref{Fig:OA_ConeSize} $\Delta^{\mathrm{OA}}$ can be quite sensitive to the choice of cone size at small values but it tends to show that the MPF is not effected by the other activity in the even when using a suitably large radius jet which includes the full recoil.

\section{Showering Studies}

In Sec.\ref{sec:ShoweringIntro} the so-called showering and topology corrections were briefly introduced as being factors which, when applied together, correct for the difference between the response of the hadronic recoil (as measured by the MPF) and the response of the jet which is needed for calibration.  
In previous JES iterations in ATLAS the assumption has been that these corrections are well modeled by the Monte Carlo simulation, and an additional conservative uncertainty was added to cover any potential differences~\cite{ATLAS-CONF-2015-057}.  
In this thesis these corrections are calculated using a purely simulation based technique to both reduce the systematic uncertainty assigned to the {\textit in-situ} JES and to further explore how the calorimeter responds to energy deposits and how that energy flows within the calorimeter.  

Sec.\ref{sec:ShoweringIntro} also introduced the true calorimeter response, which is the sum of the visible energy in the calorimeter deposited by particles in the particle jet divided by the total energy of the particle jet, and was used to define both the showering and topology corrections.  
To measure this response the `calibration hits' recorded by the GEANT4 simulation are used.  
Calibration hits are a history of the idealized interactions between the final state particles and the detector used by GEANT4 to model the deposition of energy by theses particles into the detector and the production of secondary particles advancing the shower.  
Each hit corresponds to a single stable particle which initialized the hit, and is characterized by an position (which can be associated with a calorimeter cell) and an energy.  
The energy of each hit is subdivided into energy deposited by EM interactions (EM energy) or nuclear interactions (non-EM energy), non-visible energy used to excite nuclei (invisible energy) and energy which escapes the calorimeter via neutrinos or muons (escaped energy).  
Furthermore every calibration hit is also labeled as being in an active or inactive region of a sampling calorimeter cell, or in dead material (material outside of the calorimeter).  
Using this information the true calorimeter response can be calculated by summing both the EM and non-EM energy deposited by all particles in the particle jet in the active regions of cells which have been included in a reconstructed topo-cluster.
