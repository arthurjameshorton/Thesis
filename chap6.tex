\chapter{Additional Jet Studies}

Even with a jet calibration firmly in hand additional studies on jet phenomenology can go a long way towards advancing our knowledge of the jet response and potentially moving towards better calibrations in the future.  
In this chapter the question of how the energy from the hadronic recoil in the 2$\rightarrow$2 systems used in \textit {in-situ} calibration schemes is distributed around the jet axis is explored.  
The flow of energy across the boundary of the jet definition is also studied (see the showering correction in Sec.~\ref{sec:ShoweringIntro}).  
Finally some key assumptions used in the derivation of the MPF are examined, including the relationship between the response of the recoil and the response of the jet, as well as the effect of the underlying event on the derivation of the MPF.

\end{figure}

As mentioned in Sec.~\ref{sec:ShoweringIntro} the majority of the energy from the hadronic recoil resides within a narrow energy dense core (the jet).  
In this section this statement is explored by measuring how the energy from the recoil is distributed around the calorimeter.  
This is done by measuring the average energy density in an annulus with an inner radius of $r-\Delta r$ and an inner radius of $r+\Delta r$, which is defined as
\begin{equation}
  \rho\left(r\right)  = \left( \frac{ E\left(r-\Delta r, r+\Delta r\right)}{\pi \left[\left(r +\Delta r\right)^2-\left(r -\Delta r\right)^2\right] E^{\mathrm{jet}}}\right), 
\end{equation}
where $E\left(r-\Delta r, r+\Delta r\right)$ is the sum of the energy of all clusters with a distance $R$ from the jet between $r-\Delta r$ and  $r+\Delta r$.  
As this thesis aims to measure this energy density profile in the context of an MPF based calibration results are obtained using the same selection used in the main analysis (see Sec.~\ref{Sec:SelectionCriteria}), and is also binned in $p_{\mathrm T}^{\mathrm{Ref}}$.  
The energy distribution using EM scale clusters at three different energies with Z+jet events are shown in Figs.~\ref{Fig:EMShape17-20},~\ref{Fig:EMShape60-80}, and~\ref{Fig:EMShape210-260}.  
One feature that should be understood is a dip in energy density at the boundary of the jet (in this case at $\Delta R = 0.4$).  
This dip is not a feature of the recoil or the calorimeter, but of the jet reconstruction algorithm, which creates an object which is centered on the most energetic clusters it contains.  
This dip can be explained by imagining a $\Delta R = 0.35$ jet growing into a $\Delta R = 0.4$ jet.  
If this jet growth only adds clusters with energies which are small with respect to the energy of the growing proto-jet the centre of the jet (the four-momentum sum of its constituents) does not move very much.  
If there is a cluster with a relatively high energy compared to the energy of the proto-jet the centre of the jet will move closer to this new addition.  
This process ensures that high energy clusters within a jet cannot be near the jet boundary.  
This process is especially evident for lower energy jets where even very small energy clusters represent a relatively large fraction of the total jet energy.

\end{figure}

At larger distances from the jet's core the energy density is relatively flat, which corresponds to the average pileup energy density.  
There is also a slight increase in the energy density with growing distance from the leading jet.  
This is caused by the presence of the subleading jet, which tends to be produces in the same hemisphere of the calorimeter as the reference object.

\section{Expanded MPF Derivation}

In Sec.~\ref{METProj} a derivation of the MPF was presented which considered only the hard scattering event, ignoring any potential effects of the underlying event.  
This potential deficiency in the derivation was justified by arguing that the underlying event is symmetric in $\phi$ when averaged over many events and therefore does not contribute to the measured MPF response.  
This assumption is tested in this section.  

The definition of the MPF in Eq.~\ref{EQ:MPFSimple}, is modified by a term $\Delta^{\mathrm{OA}}$ that accounts for the effect of other activity in the event on the MPF, 
\begin{equation}
  \label{Eq:MPFWithDelta}
  R_{\mathrm{recoil}}=1+\frac{\vec{E}_{\mathrm T}^{\mathrm{miss, recoil}}\cdot\hat{p}_{\mathrm T}^{\mathrm{ref}}}{E_{\mathrm T}^{\mathrm{ref}}} + \Delta^{\mathrm{OA}}, 
\end{equation}
\noindent
where it is explicitly shown that the original derivation assumed that the MET originated completely from the mismeasurement of the energy of the recoil.  
In an effort to obtain an expression in terms of measurable quantities $\vec{E}_{\mathrm T}^{\mathrm{miss, recoil}}$ is now expressed as 

\begin{equation}
  \vec{E}_{\mathrm T}^{\mathrm{miss, recoil}} = \vec{E}_{\mathrm T}^{\mathrm{recoil}} - \vec{E}_{\mathrm T}^{\mathrm{meas, recoil}}, 
\end{equation}
\noindent 
which is to say the amount of energy that isn't measured is equal to the total energy minus the energy that has been measured.  
Using the response $R_{\mathrm{recoil}}$ of the calorimeter for the recoil, 
\begin{equation}
  R_{\mathrm{recoil}}\vec{E}_{\mathrm T}^{\mathrm{recoil}} = \vec{E}_{\mathrm T}^{\mathrm{meas, recoil}}, 
\end{equation}
\noindent
which leads to 
\begin{equation}
  \vec{E}_{\mathrm T}^{\mathrm{miss, recoil}} = \vec{E}_{\mathrm T}^{\mathrm{meas, recoil}}\left(\frac{1-R_{\mathrm{recoil}}}{R_{\mathrm{recoil}}}\right).  
\end{equation}
\noindent
Using this definition of $\vec{E}_{\mathrm T}^{\mathrm{miss, recoil}}$ in Eq.~\ref{Eq:MPFWithDelta} and rearranging to solve for $\Delta^{\mathrm{OA}}$, the following expression is obtained for the contribution of the other activity to the MPF 
\begin{equation}
  \Delta^{\mathrm{OA}}=\left(R_{\mathrm{recoil}}-1\right)\left(1+\frac{\hat n_{\mathrm{ref}}\cdot \vec{E}_{\mathrm T}^{\mathrm{meas, recoil}}}{R_{\mathrm{recoil}}{E}_{\mathrm T}^{\mathrm{ref}}}\right).  
  \label{Eq:OA}
\end{equation} 
To use this expression both the response of the recoil and the measured recoil energy must be known, neither of which is true.  
To first order the effect of the other activity can be assumed to be small (as the MPF has been successfully used in jet calibration schemes in the past).  
This allows the use of the MPF itself as a measure of the response of the recoil.  
Obtaining a measurement of the full energy of the hadronic recoil at the detector level with the underlying event removed (and also without including pileup) is also a difficult issue.  
As the MPF technique already intimately connects the energy of the recoil to the energy of the jet this strategy will be used again.  
A range of jet cone sizes will be used ranging from a jet size parameter of $R$=0.1, which contains only the highest energy most central components of a jet, to $R$=1.0 which contains the vast majority of the hard scattering along with a significant amount of underlying event.   
As these are non-standard jet collections within the ATLAS collaboration the residual pileup correction is not available for all sizes considered, however it is still possible to remove the majority of the pileup from each jet using the jet area subtraction as described in Sec.~\ref{ATLASJES}.  

It is worth noting a few limitations of this technique before moving further.  
Just like in the derivation of the MPF substituting the energy of the leading jet for the energy of the recoil is a sensible substitution only when the leading jet does make up the majority of the recoil (when the balance is not spoils by ISR/FSR).  
This is ensured once again by applying both a $\Delta\phi$ and subleading jet (J2) requirement.  
In the case of this analysis $\Delta\phi\left(\mathrm{leading jet, ref}\right)$>2.9 and the $p_{\mathrm T}$ of the subleading jet without calibration must be less than 5\% of the $p_{\mathrm T}$ of the reference object ($p_{\mathrm T}^{J2}<0.05$ $p_{\mathrm T}^{\mathrm{Ref}}$).  
At low energies pileup becomes a larger issue, first by pileup jets being misidentified as the subleading jet which changes how strict the previous requirement is applied, and then by pileup jets being misidentified as the leading jet causing the event to fail the $\Delta\phi$ requirement.  
An example of how these effects change the measured response distribution in a $p_{\mathrm T}$ based response measurement can be seen in Fig.~\ref{Fig:BalDistExample}.

  \label{Fig:OA_7-10}
\end{figure}

This measure of the effect of the other activity on the MPF is shown as a function of $p_{\mathrm T}^{\mathrm Ref}$ using various jet sizes as a substitute for the energy of the recoil in Figs.~\ref{Fig:OA_1-4}~and~\ref{Fig:OA_7-10}.  
As seen in Sec.~\ref{Sec:EnergyDensity} the energy density of jets in the energy range considered remains large compared to that of pileup/underlying activity out to at least a distance of $\Delta\mathrm{r}=$ 0.4 away from the core.  
For this reason the use of jets reconstructed using size parameters lower than this value as a stand in for the energy of the recoil is known to be a bad approximation, and therefore this plots are included only for illustrative purposes.  
As shown in Fig.~\ref{Fig:OA_ConeSize} $\Delta^{\mathrm{OA}}$ can be quite sensitive to the choice of cone size at small values but it tends to show that the MPF is not effected by the other activity in the even when using a suitably large radius jet which includes the full recoil.

\section{Showering Studies}

In Sec.~\ref{sec:ShoweringIntro} the so-called showering and topology corrections were briefly introduced as being factors which, when applied together, correct for the difference between the response of the hadronic recoil (as measured by the MPF) and the response of the jet which is needed for calibration.  
In previous JES iterations in ATLAS the assumption has been that these corrections are well modeled by the Monte Carlo simulation, and an additional conservative uncertainty was added to cover any potential differences~\cite{ATLAS-CONF-2015-057}.  
In this thesis these corrections are calculated using a purely simulation based technique to both reduce the systematic uncertainty assigned to the {\textit in-situ} JES and to further explore how the calorimeter responds to energy deposits and how that energy flows within the calorimeter.  

Sec.~\ref{sec:ShoweringIntro} also introduced the true calorimeter response, which is the sum of the visible energy in the calorimeter deposited by particles in the particle jet divided by the total energy of the particle jet, and was used to define both the showering and topology corrections.  
To measure this response the `calibration hits' recorded by the GEANT4 simulation are used.  
Calibration hits are a history of the idealized interactions between the final state particles and the detector used by GEANT4 to model the deposition of energy by theses particles into the detector and the production of secondary particles advancing the shower.  
Each hit corresponds to a single stable particle which initialized the hit, and is characterized by an position (which can be associated with a calorimeter cell) and an energy.  
The energy of each hit is subdivided into energy deposited by EM interactions (EM energy) or nuclear interactions (non-EM energy), non-visible energy used to excite nuclei (called `invisible energy') and energy which escapes the calorimeter via neutrinos or muons (called `escaped energy').  
Furthermore every calibration hit is also labeled as being in an active or inactive region of a sampling calorimeter cell, or in dead material (material outside of the calorimeter).  
Using this information the true calorimeter response can be calculated by summing both the EM and non-EM energy deposited by all particles in the particle jet in the active regions of cells which have been included in a reconstructed topo-cluster and scaling the total energy of each of these cells by their sampling fraction.

 \label{Fig:ShoweringDistExample}
\end{figure}

As the energy density inside of a jet decreases with increasing distance from the core, it is more likely for energy which was inside of the jet definition at the particle level to move out at the reconstructed level than in the other direction.  
That is to say on average the true calorimeter response should be larger than the regular response, meaning the showering correction should be expected to be greater than one.  
The rate that this energy density is changing near the edge of the jet (and therefore the size of this effect) should be expected to decrease with increasing energy (as the recoil becomes more collimated) and with increasing jet size (as we move the jet boundary further to the tails of the recoil distribution).  
An example of the distribution of measured showering corrections for a single reference $p_{\mathrm T}$ bin can be seen in Fig.~\ref{Fig:ShoweringDistExample}.  
As the asymmetry of this distribution is a result of real effects (the slope of the energy density as a function of distance) and not the result of a few pathological events it is something worth measuring.  
For this reason the mean of these distributions will be plotted as a measure of the average showering correction, as opposed to fitting the distribution and using the most probable value.  

As this is a Monte Carlo only study an uncertainty on these corrections is obtained by exploring different simulation models which have been found to cover a range of showering scenarios.  
As the showering correction is largely effected by the flow of energy inside of the calorimeter, this study will explore the effects of changing the nuclear interaction models used by GEANT4.  
As a alternative to the default ATLAS model (FTFP\_BERT, introduced in Sec.~\ref{Sec:Samples}) a second model named QGSP\_BIC is used.  
This model is used as it differers from FTFP\_BERT when measuring a large number of calorimeter showering related variables~\cite{Zhang:2253040}.  
At low energies (below 9.9 GeV) QGSP\_BIC uses the \gls{BIC}, which propagates the incident particles through 3D models of nuclei that have been created using the expected density and nucleon momentum.  
Energy is lost by individual hadron/nucleon resonance formations and decays as the incident hadron travels in curved trajectories in a smooth nuclear potential.  
This differs from the Bertini Cascade model used by FTFP\_BERT below 5 GeV which models each nuclei as a continuous medium with new particles being created based on the free space cross sections for that collision.  

At higher energies (above 12 GeV) QGSP\_BIC uses the \gls{QGSM} combined with the same Precompound model used in combination with the Fritiof model in FTFP.  
Both QGSP and FTFP construct 3D models of nuclei from individual nucleons which are subsequent flattened as the incoming hadrons are boosted, and both make use of QCD strings to model the interactions between the incident hadrons and the atomic nuclei which subsequently decay resulting in secondary particles.  
The difference is that FTFP creates strings through momentum exchange which excites the hadrons and the nucleons (which subsequently decay), while QGSP exchanges partons to create strings.  
Diffractive excitations are modeled using a random transverse component sampled from a parameterized Gaussian and the longitudinal component calculated using light cone constraints~\cite{GEANT4}~\cite{GEANT4Man}.   
The gap between BIC and the QGSM (9.9 GeV - 12 GeV) is covered using the \gls{LEP} model which has it's origins in {\sc GHEISHA}\cite{Fesefeldt:1985yw}.

  \label{Fig:Showering_7-10}
\end{figure}

The showering correction using anti-$k_\mathrm{t}$ jets in a range of sizes is shown in Figs.~\ref{Fig:Showering_7-10} and~\ref{Fig:Showering_1-4}.  
As expected the showering correction decreases with energy for all jet sizes, and at higher energies the showering correction decreases with increasing jet size.  
Onces again at low energies the jet reconstruction threshold removes jets with a low $R_{\mathrm jet}$, biasing the measured mean to be high and therefore lowering the measured showering correction.  
This effect is especially evident for low energy small (anti-$k_\mathrm{t}$ R=0.1) jets as determining the leading jet with this size can be problematic.  
It is also worth noting that there is very little difference in the showering correction between the different physic lists used, with the largest differences being on the order of 0.5\% between 30-80 GeV for anti-$k_\mathrm{t}$ R=0.4 jets.  

Using Monte Carlo truth information it is possible to identify each jet as having originated from a light quark or a gluon.  
This distinction is more than just a cosmetic one, as gluon initiated jets tend to have a larger number of lower energy particles and tend to be wider (when compared to light quark initiated jets).   
These differences mean that the average jet response for a predominantly gluon jet sample (dijet for example) can be significantly different than the response in a primarily quark jet sample (both Z+jet and $\gamma$+jet), a fact which is accounted for in the JES uncertainty by both a flavour response and flavour composition uncertainty~\cite{Aaboud:2017jcu}.  
With these facts as motivation the showering correction has also been measured individually for both quark and gluon jets.

  \label{Fig:Showering_QG4}
\end{figure} 

The showering correction for both quark and gluon initiated jets can be seen in Fig.~\ref{Fig:Showering_QG4}.  
As gluon jets do tend to be wider the showering correction for them tends to be larger as well.  
Fig.~\ref{Fig:Showering_QG4} does appear to show that the choice of physics lists has a larger effect on the showering correction for gluon jets than it does on quark jets.  
Unfortunately the fraction of jets in Z+jet samples which are initiated by gluon jets is very low ($\sim$15\%) and does not allow for a fair comparison.   


\section{Topology Correction}

Along with the showering correction Sec.~\ref{sec:ShoweringIntro} introduced the topology correction, a second factor which accounts for the difference in response between the full hadronic recoil and the response of the more densely packed and higher energy particles in the particle jet.  
As the ratio of the true calorimeter response to the response as measured using the MPF the distribution of the showering correction tends to be quite wide and symmetric.
