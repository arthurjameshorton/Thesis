  abstract={The ATLAS experiment will upgrade its pixel detector with the installation of a new pixel layer in 2013–14. The new sub-detector, named Insertable B-layer (IBL), will be installed between the existing pixel detector and a new smaller radius beam-pipe at a radius of 3.3 cm. To cope with the high radiation and pixel occupancy due to the proximity to the interaction point, a new read-out chip and two different silicon sensor technologies (planar and 3D) have been developed. Furthermore, the physics performance should be improved through the reduction of pixel size while a low material budget should be imposed. A new mechanical support using lightweight staves and a CO 2 based cooling system is used. An overview of the IBL project and the status of the production of staves and the qualification of the assembly procedure, the loaded module electrical integrity and the read-out chain will be presented.}

  abstract={The ATLAS trigger system has been used very successfully for the online event selection during the LHC's first run (Run-1) between 2009 and 2013 at centre-of-mass energies (√s) between 900 GeV and 8 TeV. The trigger system consists of a hardware Level-1 (L1) and a software-based high-level trigger (HLT) that reduces the event rate from the design bunch-crossing rate of 40 MHz to an average recording rate of a few hundred Hz. During the next data-taking period (Run-2) starting in early 2015, the LHC will operate at √s = 13 TeV, resulting in roughly five times higher trigger rates. We will review the upgrades to the ATLAS trigger system that have been implemented during the long shutdown and that will allow us to cope with these increased trigger rates while maintaining or even improving our efficiencies to select relevant physics processes. These include changes to the L1 calorimeter trigger, the introduction of new L1 topological trigger modules, improvements in the L1 muon system and the merging of the previous two-level HLT system into a single event-filter farm. Finally, we will summarize the commissioning status of the trigger system in view of the imminent restart of data-taking.}
